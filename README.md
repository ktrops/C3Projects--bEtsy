# C3Projects--bEtsy
[b]Etsy will be an online store where a wide variety of products can be listed and sold by any user. In this project we will focus on reinforcing the major components of Rails, Model Validation, as well as introducing some more complex logic such as user authentication.

#### In this project you will cover

- Core comprehension of:
  - Routes
  - Controllers
  - Models
  - Views
- User based application logic
- User authentication
- Agile practices
- Group project ownership

#### Guidelines

- Groups of four will collaborate in pairs or individually
- Use a task manager like [Trello](http://trello.com) to track your team's efforts
- Build a logical user-flow that moves across multiple controllers and models
- Use HTML/CSS to style your website.

### Restrictions

- Do not use gems for user authentication (such as Devise)
- Do not use Rails `scaffold` generator (All other Rails generators are fine)

### Getting Started

1. As a group decide on an app name (this may help lead the aesthetic)
1. As a group decide on a team name (this will amuse me)
1. Create a branch on the master repo with your team name
1. Have one person on your team fork/clone the project master as per usual.
  1. Figure out your workflow for the project, re: Git and Task management

### Expectations

Build an online system for listing, selling, reviewing, and buying a wide variety of products listed by multiple merchants.

#### Guest User (Unauthenticated)

As a guest to the website (not signed in) I **can**:

    - Mailing Address
    - Name on credit card
    - Credit card number
    - Credit cart expiration
    - Credit Card CVV (security code)
    - Billing zip code
- Purchasing an order makes the following changes:
    - Reduces the number of inventory for each product

        - DateTime the order was placed
        - Link to transition the order item to marked as shipped
        - The current status of the order ("pending", "paid", "complete", "cancelled")
- View an individual order to see the user's:
    - Name
    - Email address
    - Mailing address
    - Last four digits of their credit card
    - Credit card expiration date

As a signed-in user, I **cannot**:

- Review my own products
- View order items from a shared order that belong to another merchant
- View another users private data (i.e. order fulfillment or product management)

### Model Validations

Many of our models will have attributes that are required for our application to use and display data consistently. Each model will have attributes with requirements for a valid record. The requirements are summarized below:

#### User

- Username must be present
- Username must be unique
- Email Address must be present
- Email Address must be unique
- Password Confirmation must match Password

#### Product

- Name must be present
- Name must be unique
- Price must be present
- Price must be a number
- Price must be greater than 0
- Product must belong to a User

#### Order

- An Order must have one or more Order Items

#### OrderItem

- Must belong to a Product
- Must belong to an Order
- Quantity must be present
- Quantity must be an integer
- Quantity must be greater than 0

#### Review

- Rating must be present
- Rating must be an integer
- Rating must be between 1 and 5

## Submission Guidelines
Your final project must be deployed to [Heroku](http://Heroku.com). Your team will open a single pull request for the entire project. Include the link to your Heroku deployment in the PR's description.

Your `README` file on your Github repo should contain a link to your live site.

## Team Leaders
Each team will have team leaders who are responsible for keeping track of each
team member's contributions. Rotate leader roles at the beginning of every week; every team member should be in at least one leader role during the project.

- Stand Up Leader
  - Takes notes about each person's daily report in Stand Up
  - Keeps the meeting moving
- Task Leader
  - Leads discussion on task assignment
    - Decide if a task should be completed alone or in a pair
    - Assign tasks based on...
      - Individual comfort
      - Desire
      - Ability
  - Ensures the task list stays up to date

At the end of each day, the team leaders will prepare a report containing the Stand Up notes for that day and the last of Tasks completed or started that day. Email that report to your team's Project Manager.

## Weekly Demos
In a real world work environment, a team's success is measured by their product as opposed to each individual's contribution.

Each team will present their progress and respond to questions from their Project Manager each Friday. Every team member will participate in these demos; the PM will ask specific questions regarding 1) the team's progress and plan for completing the project, 2) the technical decisions and implementation, and 3) every team member's understanding of the underlying technical structures.

# Shipping!
Build a stand-alone shipping service API that calculates estimated shipping cost for an order from another team's bEtsy application.

## Learning Goals
- Develop the ability to read 3rd party code
- APIs
    - design
    - build
    - test
- Continue working with JSON
- Revisit
    - HTTP interactions
    - Testing of 3rd party services
- Increased confidence in working with 3rd party APIs

## Guidelines
- Practice TDD to lead the development process for Models and Controllers
- Create user stories and keep the stories up-to-date throughout the project
- Deploy on Heroku
- Shipping API will communicate with the bEtsy app via JSON
- Integrate the [Active Shipping](https://github.com/Shopify/active_shipping) gem to do shipping-specific logic for you

## Project Baseline
When you've accomplished all of the baseline requirements, please issue a PR back to the bEtsy team's fork. We will review and merge your baseline, but you don't need to wait for that to happen before helping your classmates and moving on to the project requirements.

### The baseline requirements are...
- a ruby-gemset and ruby-version.
- a new rails 4.2.2 application.
- [rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails) setup in document format (hint: use a .rspec config file and the `rspec_rails` gem)
- [factory_girl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl_rails) included and set up to work with rspec
- code coverage reporting
- fork the repo from the original bEtsy team's fork
  - your team will work from branches and issue PRs back to this fork rather than the project master
- create a preliminary Heroku deployment of the bEtsy project
- review bEtsy code to come up with a basic understanding of the current checkout user flow
  - feel free to ask the "original" bEtsy team questions, but be sure you are prepared to ask them specific questions. Assume the original developers are on a new team now and are just as busy working on new work as you are.

## Expectations
Given shipping addresses and a set of packages, generate a quote for the cost of shipping for these items for a given shipper.

## Requirements
### Technical Requirements
#### Your API will:
- Respond with JSON and proper HTTP response codes
- Allow Users to get shipping cost quotes for different delivery types
- Allow Users to get a cost comparison of two or more shippers
- Log all requests and their associated responses such that an audit could be conducted
- Have appropriate error handling:
  - When a User's request is incomplete, return an appropriate error
  - When a User's request does not process in a timely manner, return an appropriate error

#### Your bEtsy application will:
- Integrate packaging estimates into the checkout workflow to be able to utilize the shipping API
- Present the relevant shipping information to the user during the checkout process
  - Cost
  - Delivery estimate
  - Tracking information (when available)

### Testing
- 95% test coverage for all API Controller routes, Model validations, and Model methods

### Added Fun!
- Do some refactoring of the bEtsy project you're working on
- Find the seam in bEtsy app between the shopping and payment processing, and build a payment processing service
